I recently finished reading _The Secret Life of Groceries: The Dark Miracle of the American Supermarket_ by Benjamin Lorr. I found it in a review posted by The New York Times. 

Generally, I enjoyed the book though it was quite stressful in some parts and pretty disheartening through and through. The book is organized into six parts which are pretty much completely different stories following specific characters in different parts of the American supermarket supply chain.

  
What follows are quotes of the book I liked, organized by chapter.

## Intro 

appalling and perfectly hygienic and safe—it is a fitting metaphor for the grocery business as whole.

ten thousand minnows piled up in silver ribbons, left for days, as they waited to be transformed into the protein base of the aquaculture pyramid.

This book is about the grocery store. About the people who work there and the routes of supply that define it.

We spend only 10 percent of our budget on food, compared to 40 percent by our great-grandparents in 1900, and 30 percent by our grandparents in the 1950s.

we now grapple with a series of problems entirely unprecedented in the history of humanity: of too much food, of using food to distribute ethical responsibility, of food as a proxy for control in our own increasingly detached lives.

In my memory I am dazed and confounded and in love in that grocery store.

all weighted by various coefficients according to their particular proprietary model, that culminates in one or two numbers used to determine its value.

beaten by rubber flanges so its feathers fall off in ragged clumps

an item within the grocery matrix loses its identity as food and becomes product. It

the maw

grocery, we’ll see, that’s completely different; it’s the business of desire.

## Part 1

the milkman gets a middle-class job, and every bottle sold over threshold is lucre

And when a neighbor lady rolled up to his dock one evening—after the general store had closed—and wished aloud that he could give her a quart of milk, the request stuck.

it was suggested that if all owners agreed to longer hours—à la Green—the chain could be called 7-Eleven.

Joe had staked himself to a strategy of paying premium wages to his employees to attract the very best, a strategy that anyone who has ever visited a 7-Eleven knows intuitively and reflexively the chain has rejected.

In conversation, he employs the wink. And it is the rare wink that actually brings you closer, creates a channel of confidence

his foibles

He keeps you guessing exactly where the line lies between calculating businessman and wholesome self-taught founder

Trader Joe’s, just like trader Joe, has perfected the ability to project integrity while simultaneously offering a very similar class of mass-produced goods that its competitors offer.

Prices were typically unmarked, and clerks would almost always charge wealthy customers more for the same item, though usually by giving them access to first-cut produce or fresher meat.

In rural areas, families might shop daily but settle up only once or twice a year.

apostasy

Saunders is inspired by a new type of novelty restaurant called the “cafeteria.”

If we want to think about the introduction of the supermarket as a birth, the cafeteria was foreplay.

One day, watching beady-eyed piglets charge a trough, Saunders decides the piggies are laughably similar to customers charging an overwhelmed clerk. In honor of all his piggy little customers, he names his new store the Piggly Wiggly.

Passing through the turnstile, the customer enters an unconscious bargain: you are invited in to frolic among the abundance, but expected to pay in the end.

Cullen wanted to build stores that were “monstrous in size,” locate them just off the downtown, and then use the power of volume to sell goods cheaper than customers had ever seen before

It was the supermarket as circus, and customers drove from fifty miles away just to tour these stores like an attraction.*

Today a Costco or Walmart can easily reach 200,000 square feet

Sylvan Goldman, an Oklahoma City grocer, introduced the shopping cart in 1937.

These changes were absorbed gradually by the American psyche, but their effect was positively dissociative to the outsider.

when Khrushchev toured Washington, D.C., in 1959, the supermarket brought a temporary détente to the Cold War.

you are the precise demographic Joe targeted way back then—the overeducated, underpaid, and inquisitive; the customer who understands and cares for the world foremost by understanding and caring for themselves

What Joe did—was one of the first to do, if not the first—was to create a store that provides products that reflect an identity, that exist in opposition to some generally homogenized mainstream.

Trader Joe’s has the single highest sales per square foot of any retail grocery chain, basically doubling its nearest competitor, Whole Foods.

Trader Joe’s customers are evangelical.

But forget the line. The produce is hit-or-miss.* I have been burned by the pre-bagged onions so many times I won’t consider them.

Two different food safety experts I spoke with told me the unofficial FDA nickname for the chain is Recall Joe’s.

He picked up the grocery flag from merely large sizes and low prices and marched it forward, planting it back down firmly in our hearts.

legacy affairs: family businesses that follow the prototypically American progression from heartwarming, bootstrapping, backstabbing founder to eager scientific expansion in the immediate offspring to a sluggish, almost hostile complacency in the third and fourth generations.*

On a whim, he heads down to the local library to take the entrance exam for Stanford University, and on that whim gets in.

Joe dropped out of Stanford as quickly and impulsively as he had enrolled. Within the month, he decided to join the air force.

then I got to know the Texas hillbillies, and the kids from West Virginia whose diet was so poor they broke their bones in basic training

So much has been written on the physical effect of the automobile on how we get our food—the suburbanization of the supermarket, the drive-in fast food, the ability to do a week’s worth of shopping in a single day.

Owl was failing and Rexall wanted the young MBA to find out why. When Joe unearths 7-Eleven in Texas as his answer, Rexall’s response is to ask him to start an imitation chain in California.

He breaks down the local union contract for grocery workers and decides Pronto will pay employees $7,000 per year for a forty-eight-hour workweek, the precise union equivalent including overtime.

he becomes obsessed with products that have a high value relative to size.

Joe sells his house, takes the entirety of his family’s modest savings, walks down to the bank, and on his personal signature borrows the rest of the money needed to buy the Pronto chain for himself.

“Safeway wouldn’t touch extra-large eggs,” Joe says. “They were afraid to run an advertisement around them because they might sell out and disappoint a customer.”

other discontinuities out there in the supply chain.

They weren’t any smarter, but college gave them a different vocabulary.” And he decided he was going to give them a chance to flex it while they shopped.

wine was a deliriously complex business

there were no Fair Trade pricing controls on imported wine

“As I learned time and time again, success in business often rests on a minute reading of regulations.”

people were stunningly clueless about value.

To Joe, the whole “health food” scene felt fraught with fad,

Joe was a true green

Within a year, TJ’s had mastered the regulations, created an alternate supply chain, and was doing 3 percent of total sales in vitamin C alone.

They beat down the doors for canned corn; it flew off the shelves and another window opened in Joe’s mind.

This was corn grown in a specific field in Idaho, isolated so it wouldn’t be cross-pollinated, and each year TJ’s would have to outbid the Japanese to buy the entire supply.

The word “retail” comes to us from the Middle French word retailler, meaning “to cut into pieces,” more etymologically related to the English word “tailor” than anything having to do with sales.

For Joe, private label needed to be an extension of the store’s identity. It would allow him to create a parallel stock of items that appeared to exist outside the national homogeny, simultaneously, continuously produced, but more precisely targeting his demographic.

Trader Joe’s invented almond butter as a consumer product

Turnover was virtually nonexistent during his reign

Like most things about Joe, this egalitarianism existed less as a separate aspirational/noble quality, more just as plain common sense.

They named it Albrecht Discount, or ALDI

Unlike Karl and Benner Tea, he wanted something with potential, and after sizing up the American grocery world, he zeroed in on Joe.

The final deal was a one-page contract and a handshake. The Albrechts were to “neither put a penny in, nor take a penny out.” Joe would stay on as CEO. No changes would be made to the way TJ’s was run.

When Joe talks about selling there is a nervous sadness.

At ALDI, this size was increasingly coupled with claustrophobic secrecy.

## Part 2

“I recommend you get yourself a Gatorade bottle.” She looks me up and down. “Wide mouth for you.” I don’t believe that I react to this. “Stop looking pale. I’m just fucking with you. Nothing in those pants looks like you’re a wide mouth anything.”

“if I ever lost my CDL for anything, they’d have to put me in the ground. This job is misery, but it’s the only thing in the world for me.”

The 1.5 percent gross margin and microscopic points of differentiation create conditions where trade secrets are very real.

At first this seems like an interviewer’s dream. A subject overflowing with commentary, dripping with color.

she simply doesn’t recognize or care about the social cues I am sending out—or actually combative, using words as a weapon.

I know things have taken a dark turn when I consider getting earplugs for hanging around a woman I am ostensibly here to interview.

the longer you are on it, the more certain something costly will happen.

Lynne estimates she grossed $200,000 last year—that is a rough calculation based on miles driven—but that she took home less than $17,000.

Lease-to-own programs in OTR trucking seem like both to me.

Now they can become owner-operators, and by signing just a few more papers

you are on the hook for the cost of the entire training, somewhere between $3,000 and $8,000

Jimmy Hoffa was a teamster first and foremost, and the strong, if corrupt, union he led was able to wrest a middle-class salary with benefits from that cohort.

From the golden ’70s, the trucker suddenly found himself in the red and green ’80s, the colors of the now essential methamphetamines drivers gobbled by the handful

Your possessions are on top of each other, your needs are on top of each other, your sexual desires and rage and annoying quirks are on top of each other.

“I know there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Because I am locked into this contract and I can’t afford to believe anything else.”

Lynne also tells me that at a truck stop she never makes eye contact with a man.

And the company was like ‘Maybe you misconstrued it,’”

That fresh apple you bite into has typically been sitting in dormancy for close to a year.

The core of this control comes from regulating ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone that causes ripening and color development. Within the right conditions, suppressing ethylene keeps fruit in a suspended state of development.

I realize just how much materialism depends on individuality, on our ability to inject meaning into things.

Seeing almost any product in bulk is debasing.

### Part 3: Self-Realization Through Snacks

the twin attributes of successful specialty: mystery and superiority.

The act of “doing” the Fancy Food Show is a little like a yuppie Halloween.

looking to monetize the family onion dip recipe, or corner the market on some new tropical plant they stumbled on during their two years in the Peace Corps

In between the booths, the floor is crawling with grocerymen.

stand up in sudden inspiration to snap a photo of a PowerPoint slide

bibimbap is described as very likely to “pop” in the next few months.

Which prompts the woman in front of me to write on her pad in purple ink: “Get $$$. Make it rain.”

that’s batshit and beautiful and I need to learn as much from her as I can.

Slawsa is as intuitive as it is baffling.

Perhaps she is good-natured without being good-humored. Perhaps she is good-humored without having a good sense of humor.

It is a laughter at her own foibles, where you are kind of worried for her

When she tells me this, crying into her hoagie at a small cafe in North Carolina, she starts apologizing immediately.

he was hitting the limits of passion without strategy.

A giant butt-sniffing,” a buyer tells me. “Like two dogs in the park, circling each other, trying to figure out if they each have what the other wants.”

Half the time it’s vertical pressure from their boss who just finally heard about coconut water and wants them to get on it.

a “slotting fee,” which is a pure cash-for-placement exchange.

It is energizing and anxiety producing, this benevolence as fuel.

The work of the food entrepreneur is marketing.

And so for months, Julie would slip out of bed at four a.m., shaking her head as she walked around her house in the dark, trying hard not to wake her husband or the dogs

## Part 4: The Retail Experience

a two-day twelve-hour orientation into the mission and philosophy of Whole Foods itself.

Passing the probation vote requires a two-thirds majority in which each team member fills out a skills sheet anonymously ranking our abilities.

concussive effect of repetitive dull content

We learn about the 7 Different Types of Difficult Customers, a sort of late-capitalist version of Snow White and her dwarfs, featuring Angry, Whiny, Hysterical, Very Important, The Chatterbox, The Know-It-All, and Mr. Multitasker.

Mr. Green is the Orwellian name for the Whole Foods internal security team

organic does not mean healthier, but rather is an option to pay extra to limit the externalities of production

That wet mix of industrial strength soap and chlorine you find in old folks’ homes that lets you know on some chthonic level the place is absolutely crawling with buggies.

we pluck melons just on the verge of rot and take them into the back room, where a woman who speaks no English stands all day carving them up into chunks and packing endless grab-n-go containers.

You’ll have a tiny little man who can barely see above the counter berating you to cut a slab of the $32.99 per pound King Salmon into progressively smaller and smaller pieces as if to prove some volumetric version of Archimedes’s paradox

We are told to apologize for any and every mistake, especially if it isn’t our fault, unless, of course, the customer is complaining about injury or food-borne illness

Andy gives us a secret phrase to use whenever we are stumped: “Sounds important.” It can be deployed almost universally to respond to questions we don’t fully understand, hectoring we don’t necessarily deserve, demands for advice we don’t particularly have,

He only opens once or twice a week so he never completely adjusts to any schedule.

Right now he’s working with Derrick, an aspiring rapper in cheese.

Its presence announces that Whole Foods seafood is for real.

Human Capital Management, or “just-in-time scheduling,”

In one of those odd, looping historical moments, one of the head engineers at Toyota, Taiichi Ohno, went to the United States on an R&D junket to visit automobile factories.

somewhere in the last ten years, just-in-time manufacturing morphed into just-in-time scheduling.

Another found that 60 percent of retail workers said that they needed to be available to fulfill every work schedule that might be assigned in a given week

There are professions where we expect people to be “on call”—doctors, first responders—but they are compensated for that both financially and in civic respect

All these things that don’t really matter until you complain, and then they matter

And so the single most enthusiastic person, the truest true believer I met in my time in retail, the guy whose answer to everything was just work harder and trust that things will work out, has found out exactly whom to trust, exactly how hard things can work out.

## Part 5: Theater of Retail

I kept thinking of the medieval practice of simony, where the wealthy could pay money to be released from their sins.

Government regulation of our food is as spotty as a fourteen-year-old boy’s first beard

Certified Paleo by the Paleo Foundation (certifying food just the way the cavemen did it!) has

These audits rarely occur unannounced, instead unfolding with all the spontaneity of a doctor’s appointment.

“People don’t hire you to blow up their deals.”

we make our money on percent livability, which usually needs to be right around 95 if we are going to make a decent profit

It was not filthy, nor a hellscape. It was instead an intensely alien, highly functional place for animals to live a sad, short life before they were set to die.

“These are retailers who’ve sucked the soul out of their business. Now they’re like an alcoholic calling me for one more drink.”

Anthropologist Daniel Miller studied purchasing decisions of Britons and Trinidadians and came to the conclusion that most people didn’t even know whether they liked something until after they shared it with others.

these are men that aren’t comfortable with their emotions

The more I reflected, the more I saw a self-serving riddle: as contradictory as any Harley hug, as cryptic as any “expensive Ralphs.”

Retail is one of the oldest, most important forms of human connection, one circle outside of family, and just as important in current society to meeting our vital needs.

## Part 6: Bottom of the Commodity Chain

Tun-Lin will feel sad about his best friend’s death, he will be terrified by it many years later when we discuss it while trying to reimagine his life on this boat

NGOs estimate 17 to 60 percent of Thai shrimp includes slave labor like Tun-Lin in its supply chain

This is called transshipment at sea. It saves fuel for the larger refrigerated fishing vessels, and it allows some boats to stay out almost indefinitely. Resupplied by others, they turn into floating prisons for trafficked workers.

you close your eyes near this smell

Rule number one when hiring people is you do not hire locals. They will want to go home. They will have families. You want someone who will live here twenty-four

Peeling shrimp is delicate labor, and despite all advances in technology, nothing can yet do the work better than small, nimble fingers.*

The word comes to us etymologically from the French commodité, meaning convenience

thirty years ago, fresh shrimp epitomized class. They cost more than steak

since 1980 prices have fallen while production has increased some 3,000 percent.

It turns out for as of yet biologically unexplained reasons, a female shrimp who loses a single eyeball gets fast-tracked through puberty

A cycle of spectacular growth, overnight riches, and then sudden collapse came to define the Asian shrimp industry.

Tun-Lin tells me he doesn’t really know what a factory is, only that people work hard there and make good money.

Estimating from a map, driving with no traffic, their trip lasts twelve hours. He tells me there are no rest stops, and that people cannot control themselves, and they urinate and defecate in the truck.

Tun-Lin asks this captain if he can leave, and the captain says yes.

Or you can hear these stories and become radicalized

catering to the aesthetic sense of consumers who don’t like to be associated with ugly things

## Afterword

his outrage at the intrusions of private equity

the chain is far more Texas libertarian than it ever was East Coast liberal

Whole Foods was the leader in progressive activism in the food industry. Then somewhere by mid-2016, everyone I knew doing that type of work got sacked.

Humanity can’t just play defense. We need a good offense too.

visiting a factory selling extremely profitable “handmade pies” that he watched get unloaded from a truck, unboxed, and reboxed into different, more “handmade” packaging. When he rushed back to tell Joe, the only response was one of those chuckles and, “Oh, maybe don’t go visiting any more suppliers without calling ahead first.”

What did you do once you became a better version of yourself? Where did all this self-improvement lead? The answer was always back to more yoga

for knowing what we want and what we are willing to give up to get it, for understanding that this is a moral outrage we’ve been digging for all along because it verifies what we know but also don’t quite want to acknowledge about ourselves.

it’s not that we are what we eat, it’s that we eat the way we are

Thai producers who have poured themselves into costly reforms only to watch buyers balk at their new prices and seek cheaper product elsewhere

He says he will open a store. A big store with lots of food the people in his village haven’t seen.
